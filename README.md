# 🩺 AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview

**AI-Powered Health Monitoring System** is a real-time health analytics platform designed to process data from wearable devices and intelligently detect health anomalies. By leveraging machine learning models such as Isolation Forest, the system identifies abnormal readings and generates personalized health recommendations.

Built using:
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- 🖥️ **Backend** (Flask, SQLAlchemy)
- 📊 **Frontend** (Streamlit)
- 🗄️ **Data Storage** (SQLite or any supported DBMS)

This solution promotes **preventive healthcare**, empowers users with actionable insights, and demonstrates the potential of AI in personal wellness tracking.
